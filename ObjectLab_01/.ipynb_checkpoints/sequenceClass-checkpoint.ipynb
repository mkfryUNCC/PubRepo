    "#In a new notebook, write a new Python Class called Sequence.  This class should have one instance variables initialized by the constructor, a string that will hold the sequence of bases.  In addition, this class should have one method that executes a function of your choosing. Think about what sequences can do or how they can change, and implement that as a function of this class. If you need inspiration, look back on some of the early things we did last semester.\n",

    "Once you are confident your sequence class is written properly, write another class called SequenceRecord.  The constructor of this class will take two arguments, a “label” and a Sequence Object.  Your code should attempt to enforce that a valid Sequence Object was provided.\n",

    "Now that you have your two classes, write a Python generator that you might use to parse a FASTA file.  Only now, rather than yielding a tuple of your header and sequence, your generator should yield a SequenceRecord object. It would be a good idea to quickly make yourself a 2-3 entry long FASTA file to call your generator with to test it’s functionality."
