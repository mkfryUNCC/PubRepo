    "#In a new notebook, write a new Python Class called Sequence.  This class should have one instance variables initialized by the constructor, a string that will hold the sequence of bases.  In addition, this class should have one method that executes a function of your choosing. Think about what sequences can do or how they can change, and implement that as a function of this class. If you need inspiration, look back on some of the early things we did last semester.\n",

Only now, rather than yielding a tuple of your header and sequence, your generator should yield a SequenceRecord object. It would be a good idea to quickly make yourself a 2-3 entry long FASTA file to call your generator with to test it’s functionality."
